Python Inheritance:-
                Inheritance enables us to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class
                and allows us to add more. In this tutorial, you will learn to use inheritance in Python.

Inheritance in Python:-
                    Inheritance is a powerful feature in object oriented programming.
                    It refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class.
                    The new class is called derived (or child) class and the one from which it inherits is called the base (or parent) class.

What Is Inheritance:-
            Code reusability :- we do not have to write the same code again and again,
                                we can just inherit the properties we need in a child class.

            It represents a real world relationship between parent class and child class.

            It is transitive in nature. If a child class inherits properties from a parent class,
            then all other sub-classes of the child class will also inherit the properties of the parent class.

Types Of Inheritance:-
                    Single Inheritance
                    Multiple Inheritance
                    Multilevel Inheritance
                    Hierarchical Inheritance
                    Hybrid Inheritance
